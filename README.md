## You have just discovered Tehiru.

Tehiru provides a method for spatial enhancement of single channel audio recordings. The principle behind it, is a simple architecture of audio filters, which is being derived from electro-acoustic and geometrical
parameters. Thus, it allows the aforementioned enhancement with only
three parameters denoting the desired recording technique, focus on the sound source and the position(angle) of the source.


Here you will find the MATLAB prototype and a real-time implementation(VST).
The real-time implementation is based on the JUCE C++ class library. Alongside the source code, a pre-compiled version can be found under the 
"Builds" folder. 

## Usage
In case that the real-time implementation is desired, either the pre-compiled version can be directly inserted into a host applications, or it can be rebuilt by acquiring proper SDKs(Steinberg's VST).

On the other hand, the prototype can be used in MATLAB by calling 
the main function "recordsimul.m" i.e.:
my_stereo_output = recordsimul(mono_input, sampling_frequency, desired_technique, desired_focus, desired_source_angle);
